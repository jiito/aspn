 - DESCRIPTION:
   - Read through articles on load-balancing, HTTP, and TCP.
   - Investigated multiple open-source frameworks for building microservices with Wasm.
   - It seems that these open-source programs would be something to build off
     and the planned use of docker could be switched with Wasm.
   - Scheduled meeting with Pete to discuss implementation.
